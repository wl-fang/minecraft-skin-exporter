# minecraft-skin-exporter
Export a serialized Minecraft Skin from a username.

This is a Python HTTP server that receives an HTTP request containing a Minecraft username and returns a serialized string describing the skin of the user.
This was developed to allow me to construct Minecraft skins from a username within Roblox as a part of a larger project.
